/**
 * The only way the rest of the app reaches the database.
 *
 * **The rule this exists to enforce, and why it is structural rather than a
 * convention.** Every read of user data filters tombstones. A single forgotten
 * `deleted_at IS NULL` is a leak of something the person believed they had
 * deleted, and the symptom is an entry reappearing in a search result or an
 * export months later, long after anyone could connect it to the cause.
 *
 * So reads go through the `live_*` views, which filter by construction, and
 * nothing outside this package holds a database handle at all. Reading
 * tombstones requires calling something whose name says so.
 *
 * Writes set the six columns the data contract requires and bump `rev`. The
 * change log is not written here: it is appended by triggers in the schema, in
 * the same transaction as the write, because a rule the application has to
 * remember is a rule that gets forgotten exactly once, silently.
 *
 * Every method suspends onto `Dispatchers.IO`. There is no way to reach the
 * database from the main thread through this class.
